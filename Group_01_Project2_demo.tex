\section{Introduction}\label{sec:Intro}}

Data come from the FIES (Family Income and Expenditure Survey) recorded
in the Philippines. The survey, which is undertaken every three years,
is aimed at providing data on family income and expenditure. The data
obtained from this survey are from different regions across the
Philippines. This report will focus on one individual area, the
Cordillera Administrative Region and so region has been removed from the
dataset as it will not be informative as an explanatory variable.

The report will investigate which household related variables influence
the number of people living in a household. The data used consists of
1725 observations of ten variables, two of which are categorical and the
remaining are numerical.

\hypertarget{sec:EDA}{%
\section{Exploratory Data Analysis}\label{sec:EDA}}

Figure 1 shows the distribution of the response variable: Number of
members in a household (variable name
``Total.number.of.family.members''). The modal response is 4 members and
the distribution is right-skewed,

\begin{figure}[H]

}

\caption{Distribution of Response Variable}\label{fig:distribution of response variable}
\end{figure}

The summary below shows the count data for each level of the response
variable and the percentage of total households in the region in each
group.

Table 1 shows summary data for all the numerical variables.There is no
missing data within these variables and so no values will need to be
imputed for the analysis in the report. The response variable, total
number of family members in a household, ranges from 1 to 15, with the
middle 50\% of number of family members falling between 3 and 6 also an
average number of family members of 4.67. There appear to be possible
outliers at the maximum values of Total Household Income and House Floor
Area. The total household income is range from 11988 to 6042860
Philippine Peso. The middle 50\% of total household income is between
118565 and 328335, with an income of 269540.48 peso on average. The
third variable is total food expenditure, in Phillipine peso, which is
the range of 6781 to 327724, with the middle 50\% lies between 51922 and
98493. Then, the household head's age is range from 17 to 99 years, with
the middle 50\% falling between 41 and 63 years of age. Next, the house
floor area is range from 5 to 900 square metres. The central 50\% of the
variable house floor area is between 32 and 102 with an average area of
90.92. The sixth explanatory variable is the house (building) age and it
ranges in value from 0 to 100, with the middle 50\% falling between 12
and 31. The number of bedrooms in the house ranges from 0 to 9 with a
mean average number of bedrooms of 2.26 per household. Finally, we may
look at the binary variable electricity, which denotes whether the
property has electricity access or not, the average score of electricity
is 0.93, which means 93\% household have electricity.

The correlation coefficient between all numerical variables are shown in
Table 2. There is a moderate positive correlation (0.611) between the
total household income and the household food expenditure. Additionally
there is a slight positive correlation between the total household
income and the number of bedrooms in the household (0.441) and the
number of family members and total food expenditure (0.469). The other
variables are all weakly correlated.The correlation coefficient between
household Head's age, house floor area, house age and total number of
family members are negative, which shows the rise of those three
variables will lead to a reduction in the expected number of family
members in a household.

Table 3 shows the summaries of the two categorical variables. Single
family households make up approximately two-thirds of the survey
responses in this region and only 0.5\% (8) of responses came from
households formed from non-related individuals. Of the 1725 households,
less than a quarter (21.4\%) had a female head of household.

The pairs plot in Figure 2 is colour coded to illustrate any differences
between the distributions of the quantitative variables when the head of
household sex is included as a factor. The plots suggest the sex of the
head of household may impact the number of family members in the
household and the age of the head of the household.

Figure 3 shows that an extended family household or one formed by
non-related individuals is more likely to have a female head, whereas a
larger proportion of single family households have male heads.

\subsection{The relationship between independent and dependent
variables}\label{the-relationship-between-independent-and-dependent-variables}}

We will explore whether nine variables related to households in the
dataset have an impact on the number of people living in the house
(Total.Number.of.Family.members). These nine variables are Annual
household income, Annual expenditure by the household on food, Head of
the households sex, Head of the households age, Relationship between the
group of people living in the house, Floor area of the house, Age of the
building, Number of bedrooms in the house and House electrification
situation.

First let's look at the scatterplot of the response variable versus the
numerical variable.

\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{Group_01_Project2_demo_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-1-1} \end{center}

\hypertarget{gender-age}{%
\subsection{Gender \& Age}\label{gender-age}}

As highlighted by the pairs plot, there appears to be a relationship
between the sex and age of the head of the household.

The minimum and maximum ages of household heads do not appear to differ
greatly according to the individuals' sex, however they do differ at the
25th, 50th and 75th percentiles with male heads of households being
consitently younger than their female counterparts. The standard
deviation is also greater for the female group, but the substantially
smaller group size for females may contribute to this larger variation.

The boxplot in Figure 4 illustrates the previously summarised data. The
boxplot identifies the two oldest male head of households as outliers
(shown by the points above the whisker), however within the context of
the data and when compared to the ages of female head of household
boxplot, these ages do not appear unreasonable or unrealistic.

The following Mann-Whitney U-test shows that there is a statistically
significant difference in the median ages of male and female head of
households at a 5\% level.

\hypertarget{household-income-and-food-expenditure}{%
\subsection{Household Income and Food
Expenditure}\label{household-income-and-food-expenditure}}

Figure 5 shows a boxplot of household incomes suggests a heavily skewed
distribution with many outliers at the upper end of the distribution.

\begin{figure}[H]

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{Group_01_Project2_demo_files/figure-latex/balance boxplot-1} 

}

\caption{Household Incomes in 10000 Phillipine Pesos.}\label{fig:balance boxplot}
\end{figure}

The following boxplot in Figure 6 shows the log transformed household
income and shows there are still several outliers following the
transformation.

\begin{figure}[H]

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{Group_01_Project2_demo_files/figure-latex/balance boxplot2-1} 

}

\caption{Boxplot of log transformed Incomes.}\label{fig:balance boxplot2}
\end{figure}

The scatterplot in Figure 7 of household income against total food
expenditure suggests a positive correlation but the fitted model may be
being heavily influenced by the extreme values, particularly by one
extreme point.

\begin{figure}[H]

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{Group_01_Project2_demo_files/figure-latex/balance_plot-1} 

}

\caption{Scatterplot of Income against Food Expenditure.}\label{fig:balance_plot}
\end{figure}

Figure 7 again highlights a possible outlier in terms of income, this
could be a data entry error or just an outlier at the maximum. Removing
this observation from the data set and plotting provides the following
scatter diagram in Figure 8. This plot reconfirms the suggested positive
correlation, but there is still an imbalance in the amount of data
available at different levels of income. For example, most data is
available for incomes between 0 and 750000 peso, but far fewer data
points occur above this income level.

\begin{figure}[H]

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{Group_01_Project2_demo_files/figure-latex/balance without outlier-1}

\caption{Scatterplot of Income and Food Expenditure with extreme value removed.}\label{fig:balance without outlier}

\hypertarget{number-of-family-members-head-of-household-sex}{%

}

\caption{Number of Members in Household by Sex of Head of Household}\label{fig:boxplot of sex and members}
\end{figure}

Hence we can see from Figure 9 that households with a male head appear
to have a greater number of family members on average than those with a
female head, as the male group has larger values for the first and third
quartiles and the median. However there is overlap between the two
groups central IQR and so the distributions may not be significantly
different.

\hypertarget{glm-model-exploration}{%
\subsection{GLM Model Exploration}\label{glm-model-exploration}}

Prior to exploring any models, the outlier for Total Household Income
and corresponding measurements for the other variables from this
individual are removed.

The following code identifies which explanatory variables would be
included to produce the best models of different sizes, in this instance
the maximum number of variables specified is ten. The output suggests
the first predictor to be included is the total food expenditure in
10000 Phillipine pesos, and the last to be included is the binary
variable Electricity that identifies if a household has electricity.
Comparing each of the ten models produced by BIC, CP and adjusted R\^{}2
criteria is inconclusive as each implies a different model is best.

\subsection{Poisson Regression model}\label{poisson-regression-model}}

The response variable of the Total Number of Family Members (or members
of the household) can be viewed as a count and therefore a Poisson
Regression model is considered. For a Poisson model to be suitable, the
mean and variance should be equal and so these assumptions are checked
first.

\begin{table}

Mean & 4.669373\\

Variance & 5.446049\\

\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The variation of total number of family members is only marginally
larger than the mean of total number of family members, thus, the
possibility of over-dispersion in our model is not a significant issue.

The poisson model fitted with all possible covariates concludes there
are six statistically significant predictors at the 5\% level. These are
the total household income and food expenditure, the age and gender of
the head of the household, the age of the house and if it is a single
family household. Table 5 shows the estimates and the lower and upper
bounds of the 95\% confidence intervals for the regression parameters.
The rows containing significant predictors, and so where the confidence
intervals do not include 0, are highlighted.

We refit the model to include just the previously identified significant
covariates and again evaluated the 95\% confidence intervals for the
estimated parameters, these values can be seen in Table 6. The intercept
term of 1.436 is simply a positional constant due to the context of the
variables. The negative coefficient of Total Household Income shows that
for every additional 10000 peso, the number of household members is
expected to decrease by 0.002. The coefficient of Total Food Expenditure
suggests that for an increase of 10000 peso in spending, there is an
expected 0.048 more members in the household. The coefficients of Head
of Household age and the Age of the Building are both negative (-0.003
and -0.002 respectively) showing that an older head of the household or
older building is linked to fewer members in a household. A Single
Family household is expected to have 0.350 fewer members than the
baseline category of an extended family household, and households with a
male head will have 0.222 members more than their female counterparts.
